           <p>My name is Brad Pitt. I am an actor from Shawnee, Oklahoma, though I now live in Los Angeles like every other actor.</p>
           <p>I have a wide range of acting skills, from action and thriller to comedy and drama. I am known for playing charismatic male leads, and have been described as the world's most attractive man by several media outlets. Nowadays I prefer subtler roles, including those where I play a father figure, which I am to my six children.</p>
           <p>Apart from acting, I have experience as a producer for many films with my own production company Plan B Entertainment, of which I am the CEO. In my spare time, I enjoy philantropy, architecture, and skateboarding. In my work with the Make It Right Foundation, I get to combine at least two of these interests—sometimes all three!</p>
